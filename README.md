Water Scarcity: Smart Water Management System
=============================================

Project Overview
----------------

Water scarcity is one of the most critical issues facing the world today. Efficient and intelligent water management is essential to ensure sustainable water usage. This project aims to develop a Smart Water Management System that leverages cutting-edge technologies to monitor, analyze, and optimize water usage. By deploying IoT sensors, building real-time dashboards, and integrating predictive analytics, we will create a system that not only tracks water consumption but also provides actionable insights for better water management.

Project Goals
-------------

*   **Real-Time Monitoring:** Deploy IoT sensors to monitor water levels, flow rates, and usage in real-time.
*   **Leak Detection:** Implement algorithms to detect leaks early, preventing water loss and damage.
*   **Usage Reports:** Generate detailed usage reports to help users understand and optimize their water consumption.
*   **Automated Irrigation:** Design a smart irrigation system that adjusts water usage based on weather forecasts and soil moisture levels.
*   **User Alerts:** Develop a user-friendly dashboard that provides real-time data, with the ability to send SMS alerts for critical events.

Research Steps
--------------

1.  **Literature Review:** Conduct a comprehensive review of existing smart water management systems, IoT sensor technologies, and predictive analytics models.
2.  **Technology Selection:** Evaluate and select the appropriate IoT sensors for water monitoring, and choose the most suitable frontend and backend technologies.
3.  **Data Collection:** Set up IoT sensors in a controlled environment to collect water usage data for analysis.
4.  **Predictive Modeling:** Utilize Scikit-learn to develop and train predictive models for water usage and leak detection.
5.  **Dashboard Development:** Design and implement a Vue.js-based frontend to display real-time data, usage reports, and alerts.
6.  **Backend Integration:** Develop a FastAPI backend to handle data processing, storage, and integration with predictive models.
7.  **Testing and Validation:** Test the system in various scenarios to ensure accuracy, reliability, and user-friendliness.
8.  **Deployment:** Deploy the system in a real-world environment and monitor its performance.
9.  **User Feedback:** Collect feedback from users to continuously improve the system.

Tools and Technologies
----------------------

*   **IoT Sensors:** For real-time water monitoring.
*   **Frontend:** Vue.js for creating interactive and responsive dashboards.
*   **Backend:** FastAPI for building a robust and scalable backend.
*   **Predictive Analytics:** Scikit-learn for developing models to predict water usage and detect leaks.
*   **Data Storage:** A suitable database for storing water usage data.
*   **Alerting System:** SMS gateways for sending real-time alerts to users.
*   **Automated Testing:** Tools like PyTest for backend testing and Jest for frontend testing.
*   **Version Control:** Git for managing the source code and collaboration.
*   **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
